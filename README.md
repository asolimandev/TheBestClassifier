**Effort: 20 min**

In this lab, you will import a notebook in Watson Studio and perform the Classification

### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

*   Import a Notebook in Watson Studio
    
*   Solve Classification Problems
    

### `Instructions`

Now that you have been equipped with the skills to use different Machine Learning algorithms, over the course of five weeks, you will have the opportunity to practice and apply it on a dataset. In this project, you will complete a notebook where you will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

You load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

*   k-Nearest Neighbour
    
*   Decision Tree
    
*   Support Vector Machine
    
*   Logistic Regression
    

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

*   Jaccard index
    
*   F1-score
    
*   LogLoass
    

### `Step-By-Step Assignment Instructions`

#### Instructions:

**A- Sign in into Watson Studio and import your notebook**

1.  Sign in into [https://cloud.ibm.com/login](https://cloud.ibm.com/login?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkML0101ENSkillsNetwork20718538-2022-01-01)
    
2.  Click on _New Project_
    
3.  On the Create a project page, select **Create an empty project**.
    
4.  Give a name to your project, and a description for your reference, then setup your project as following and click _Create_.
    

**Notice 1:** because you are going to share this project with your peer for evaluation, please make sure you have unchecked `Restrict who can be a collaborator`

**Notice 2:** You have to create an IBM Object Storage, if you dont have any IBM Object Storage (you can use the free Lite plan

5.  From the top-right, Click on _Add to project_, and then select _Notebook_.
    
6.  In the _New notebook_ form, click on _From URL_, and enter the Notebook URL: [https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule\_Coursera/ML0101EN-Proj-Loan-py-v1.ipynb](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera/ML0101EN-Proj-Loan-py-v1.ipynb)
    
7.  Give the notebook a proper name and description and click on `Create Notebook` to initialize the notebook.
    

**B. Complete the notebook**

1.  Start running the notebook
    
2.  Complete the notebook based on the description in the notebook.
